# Bird_species_prediction
In this project, I created a convolutional Neural Network which will be able to predict species of the bird. I used different layers and other hyperparameters for building, training and testing this multiclass classifictaion model. I used keras for this project.
I started with loading the dataset into google colab using google drive and visualizing the images. Normalizing is an important step when working with any type of dataset. After that I created a CNN Model which is further used for predicting the bird species using the image supplied to model.
This project can be used for educational purposes to get a better understanding of how to create network architecture for a CNN model. We can further hyper parameter tune this model to reach a higher accuracy. It can be used by bird sanctuaries to identify different types of birds.
